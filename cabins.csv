# Below are given the number of passengers, in total (total) and per class (fc, sc, tc, fsc, stc, and fstc), who could be accomodated in every deck.
# For example, take deck E that can accomodate a total number of 597 (total) passengers. Specifically, 16 (fc) of these passengers could be 1st class,
# 62 (sc) 2nd class, and 212 (tc) 3rd class. Apart from these cabins, there were also a number of other cabins that could accomodate, both 1st, and
# 2nd class passengers. These passengers, in total, were 319 (fsc, i.e. 1st and 2nd class). As you can imagine, although these cabins could accomodate
# both classes, 1st class passengers would enjoy higher priority, in case of an overbooking of other 1st class cabins had happend.
